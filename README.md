# State_space_framework_for_microbial_interaction_variability
## Introduction
This repository provides the codes and demo files for the analysis of our paper "State-Space-Based Framework for Predicting Microbial Interaction Variability in Wastewater Treatment Plants". If you are interested in our work, please refer to https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.2c02844. Hope our framework can help you with your own research.

(2022-08-10): More details for the codes will be updated soon. Thank you for your patience.
